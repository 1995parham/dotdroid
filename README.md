## Introduction

I began my mobile journey with the [Sony Ericsson K800i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_K800i),
followed by the [Nokia N96](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N96), and eventually transitioned
to the world of smartphones.

[Xperia X10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_Xperia_X10) was my first Android phone, the experience was terrible.
I was a teenager and I want to run multiple applications with my phone and comparable to my friends iPhone it was socks.
Then I bought [Xperia Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Xperia_Z) before going into the iOS world.

Then I had iPhone 3g, after that I bought iPhone 4 and continue with it until I bought iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7.
After having these multiple models of iPhone, I finally decide to back with android, so I bought [Samsung Galaxy S9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S9).
After a while I bought [Samsung Galaxy S21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S21), [Nothing Phone (1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Phone_1)
and now I have [Nothing Phone (2a)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Phone_2a)

The experience with Android so far is better than iOS, and it has more free and open source applications.
Nothing Phone (1) / Noting Phone (2a) is also comparable to its price is awesome. Nothing Phone also supports 5G in my homeland.

## Good to know

### S-Pen is not working

For anyone that's having a problem with their s-pen such as needing to press harder on the screen just for it to register or work to scroll etc etc take the s-pen out of the phone and hold it in your hand
at the top near the clicker and take your other hand and FLICK it (kind of like if you were going to flick the back of someones ear, lol) pretty good a couple of times at the bottom near the TIP and then
try to see if the sensitivity changes back to the way its supposed to be like on the older Notes.. It has something to do with the spring or something in there and if you flick it a few times pretty hard
it fixes the spring holding the s-pen tip and then it'll work like a charm! Obviously don't try to flick it hard enough to break it people! [Source](https://xdaforums.com/t/s-pen-sensitivity-fix.4159589/)
