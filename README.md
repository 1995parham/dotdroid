## Introduction

[Xperia X10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_Xperia_X10) was my first Android phone, the experience was tribble.
I was a teeneger and I want to run multiple applications with my phone and comparable to my friends iPhone it was socks.

Then I had iPhone 3g, after that I bought IPhone 4 and continue with it until I bought iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7.
After having these multiple models of iPhone, I finally decide to back with android, so I bought [Samsung Galaxy S9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S9).
After a while I bought [Samsung Galaxy S21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S21) and now I have [Nothing Phone (1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Phone_1).

The experience with Android so far is better than iOS and it has more free and open source applications.
Nothing Phone (1) is also comparable to its price is awesome. Nothing Phone also supports 5G in my homeland.
