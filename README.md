## Introduction

I began my mobile journey with the [Sony Ericsson K800i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_K800i),
followed by the [Nokia N96](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N96), and eventually transitioned
to the world of smartphones.

[Xperia X10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_Xperia_X10) was my first Android phone, the experience was terrible.
I was a teenager and I want to run multiple applications with my phone and comparable to my friends iPhone it was socks.
Then I bought [Xperia Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Xperia_Z) before going into the iOS world.

Then I had iPhone 3g, after that I bought iPhone 4 and continue with it until I bought iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7.
After having these multiple models of iPhone, I finally decide to back with android, so I bought [Samsung Galaxy S9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S9).
After a while I bought [Samsung Galaxy S21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S21), [Nothing Phone (1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Phone_1)
and now I have [Nothing Phone (2a)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Phone_2a)

The experience with Android so far is better than iOS, and it has more free and open source applications.
Nothing Phone (1) / Noting Phone (2a) is also comparable to its price is awesome. Nothing Phone also supports 5G in my homeland.

## Termux

Termux is a powerful terminal emulation for Android, with broad community and robust package manager.
Making it easier to run Linux computing right in your pocket these days.

```bash
pkg install openssh
```

To start the SSH server, run this command

```bash
sshd
```

If you need to kill the server, just kill its process

```bash
pkill sshd
```

Password authentication is enabled by default on termux and it listens on 8022 port,
but you can still review the configuration by running:

```bash
cat $PREFIX/etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```
PrintMotd yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

Set new password

```bash
passwd
```

Please note that, termux doesn't have any user, so you can use anything in your ssh connection.
After having successful connection it is better to install ssh-keys and disable password authentication.

There is a chance that you need to do the ssh connection when you phone is connected to your laptop.

```bash
adb forward tcp:8022 tcp:8022

ssh 127.0.0.1 -p 8022
```
